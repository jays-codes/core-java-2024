# core-java-2024

Jay's proj repo for Core Java practice. List below ARE NOT NOTES. They are topics covered.

practice:
- Factorial with recursive and iterative solution

proj: functionalprog (mvn, jdk21, junit5)
- LinkedList: addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), removeLast()
- Stack: push(), pop()
- List: replaceAll(), set()
- Collections practice; Collection methods: forEach(), removeIf(), Arrays.asList(), add()
- Streams Assignment #8-14
- Streams Assignment #1-7
- Parallel Streams demo
- Optionals Demo
